 THIS IS THE MAIN GATEKEEPER
 
 This controls WHICH records show up on a website, based upon a set of rules.
 
 It returns True or False given:
    1. the requests.user object (which can be None)
    2. one of the PBSMM objects (Episode, Season, Site, Special)

 How this works:

    There are five possible publish states an object can be in.
        1. (publish_status =  1): Object is PERMANANTLY LIVE - think of this as a ALWAYS ON switch
        2. (publish_status =  0): Object is CONDITIONALLY LIVE - the "live_as_of" date is in the past
        3. (publish_status =  0): Object is PENDING LIVE - the "live_as_of" date is still in the future
        4. (publish_status =  0): Object is NOT YET PUBLISHED - the "live_as_of" date is NULL
        5. (publish_status = -1): Object is PERMANENTLY OFFLINE - this is the ALWAYS OFF Switch

 Page requesters can either be logged in to the Django Admin (i.e., staff) or not (i.e., the general public)

    RULE 1:   Objects - when created - start off with publish_status = 0 and live_as_of = None
        This means that the logged-in Admin user can edit the record and "see" the page for Q/A,
            but it is NOT AVAILABLE to the public.

    RULL 2:   Objects ONLY EVER appear to the public (i.e., 'are live') if:
        a. The publish_status = 1 regardless of the live_as_of date
        b. The publish_status = 0 AND the live_as_of date exists and is in the past.

    RULE 3:   Objects with a publish_status of -1 don't appear on the site to ANYONE.

    RULE 4:   Objects are shown on model listing pages to the public ONLY IF:
        a.  The object is "live" (see Rule 2)
        b.  Any PARENT objects ARE ALSO "live" (but see exception below)
        

STANDLONE OBJECTS:

    For objects with the treat_as_standalone field, and where that field == 1, the above rules apply
    EXCEPT FOR Rule 4b:   "standalone" objects do NOT CHECK their parents' publish states.

    RAD: 4 Oct 2018 --- so a weird condition happened, and I'm not sure what the appropriate

        get blocked or not?
