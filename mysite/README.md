# Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper is a simple Django app that enables "Set it and Forget it!" publishing behavior for models.



## Quick start

1. Add "gatekeeper" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'gatekeeper',
    ]
    ```

## Gatekeeping Models

For models where you want to manage when each instance is available to the public, all you need to do is subclass the 
`GatekeeperAbstractModel` abstract class, e.g.:

```
from django.db import models
from gatekeeper.models import GatekeeperAbstractModel

class Article(GatekeeperAbstractModel):
    ... (your custom fields go here)
```

The superclass creates two fields:

1. `live_as_of` (DateTime, default = None) - this is the timestamp of when the object should go live.  If it's not set (None) you can think of this as an "in development" phase.  For an Article model, you've created the instance, but you're still writing the Article.  You can preview it through the Admin, but it's not live on the site.

2. `publish_status` (controlled vocabulary, default = None) - this has 4 possible values:

* None = has never been published
* 0 = "use live_as_of" date to determine if the object is available to the public
* 1 = "always on" - hard-wired to be always available to the public
* -1 = "permanently off" - hard-wired to NEVER be available to the public

You set the `publish_status` and `live_as_of` values through the Admin

## View Code

Setting up gatekeeping for models is easy!  Using the Article model as an example, here is the corresponding view code for a listing and a detail view.

```
from django.views.generic import DetailView, ListView
from .models import Article
from gatekeeper.mixins import GatekeeperListMixin, GatekeeperDetailMixin

class ArticleListView(GatekeeperListMixin, ListView):
    model = Article
    template_name = 'article/article_list.html'
    context_object_name = 'articles'
    
        
class ArticleDetailView(GatekeeperDetailMixin, DetailView):
    model = Article
    template_name = 'article/article_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'article'
```

What's happening behind the scenes:

1. In the ListView, the gatekeeper is filtering the model with the following rules:

    1. If the user is logged into the Admin and `publish_status` != -1, _include the model instance_
    2. If there is no user, and the `publish_status` = 1, _include the model instance_
    3. If there is no user, `publish_status` = 0, *and* the current date/time > `live_as_of`, _include the model instance_.
    4. Return the filtered list of model instances.
    
2. In the DetailView, the gatekeeper follows the same rules, but will throw a 404 error, if the user is not logged into the Admin and the request object isn't "live" yet.

## Showing Model Instances Serially

In some situations, you only want a single instance of model to be "live" on the site at a time.   You can use the Gatekeeper to do this.   

A good example would be a Home page app.   You can queue up different renditions of the home page to go live at different times.

Here, there's only a small change to the model and view code:

```
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
from gatekeeper.models import GatekeeperSerialAbstractModel

class Homepage(GatekeeperSerialAbstractModel):
    title = models.CharField (
        _('Title'),
        max_length = 200,
        null = False
    )

    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('homepage-detail', args=(self.pk))    
        
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

    class Meta:
        verbose_name = 'Home Page'
        verbose_name_plural = 'Home Pages'
   
```

As before, the`GatekeeperSerialAbstractModel` creates the `live_as_of` and `publish_status` fields.   It also creates a `default_live` field.   

The View code becomes:

```
from django.views.generic import DetailView
from gatekeeper.mixins import GatekeeperSerialMixin

class HomepageDetailView(GatekeeperSerialMixin, DetailView):
    model = Homepage
    template_name = 'homepage/homepage_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'homepage'
```

For the `urls.py` there's a slight twist:

```
from django.urls import path
from .views import HomepageDetailView

urlpatterns = (
    path('', HomepageDetailView.as_view(), name='homepage-live'),
    path('homepage/<int:pk>/', HomepageDetailView.as_view(), name='homepage-detail'),
)
```

What's happening behind the scenes:

1. If you are logged into the Admin you can view any Homepage instance (with the `/homepage/<pk>/` URL).
2. However, for the "live" site, we send the `pk`-less URL.
3. The `GatekeeperSerialMixin` mixin - if no PK is provided, will attempt to find the "most approrpiate" instance of the model.

How does it do that?

    Rule 0: Only objects that COULD be in play can play
    
    Rule 1: if your date is in the future, then you can't play
    
    Rule 2: pick from the ones with "date set" that's in the past who have been published (i.e., `live_as_of` is not None)
    
    Rule 3: Barring that - pick the most-recently modified page with `publish_status` = 1
            (this is because it IS possible for a "always on" page to have never gone through
            the publish step with a publish date - it's just FORCED TO BE ON)
    
    Rule 4: Barring THAT - pick the most-recently modified page with `publish_status` != -1 that has `default_live` = True.
            
    Rule 5: Barring THAT - None (and 404).

Note Rule #4 --- this is where the `default_live` field comes into play.   You can define a model instance with `default_live` = True.  This item will be return if no other instance passes the rules.  Basically it's can be a generic "fall back" for the model so that the public page ALWAYS returns something.   Handy!

## The Admin Interface

Gatekeeper alters the default Admin for models that use it.

### List Display

For the basic gatekeeper, two fields are added to the `list_display` (they'll appear after anything set in the ModelAdmin):

1. A `show_publish_status` that takes the `live_as_of` and `publish_status` fields and creates a human-friendly string from them;
2. A `available_to_public` model property that returns True/False to show "is this available to the public"?

For the "serial" gatekeeper, there are also two fields:

1. `show_public_status` as before
2. `is_live` - returns True/False to show which item is the one that will appear on the live site.

### Fieldsets

All Gatekeeper-related fields are displayed on the model Admin edit page in a fieldset called "Gatekeeper".

### Admin actions

For convenience in the listing page of the Admin, five Admin actions have been defined:

1. "Revert to Preview/Pending status":   this sets `live_as_of` and `publish_status` to None.   The item is no longer live, and won't go live until these values are changed;
2. "Take Item PERMANENTLY LIVE": this sets `publish_status` = 1 --- the item will be live;
3. "Take Live as of Right Now":  this sets `live_as_of` = "now", and `publish_status` = 0 --- the item will be live;
4. "CONDITIONALLY online using `live_as_of` date": this sets `publish_status = 0` and keeps `live_as_of` to whatever it was before.   You'd use this if you wanted to change a PERMANENTLY LIVE or COMPLETELY OFFLINE setting;
5. "Take item COMPLETELY OFFLINE": this sets `publish_status` = -1 --- the item disappears from the site entirely.


## Parental Gatekeeping

(To be added from the PBSMM test case)

Sometimes you have a model that has a FK relationship to another model, and you want both of them to be under gate-keeping.   If "parent" model A's gatekeeping should influence model B, you can set things to override model B based upon the settings for model A.

For example, if you have models for Author and Book, you can set it up that if the Author is not live, then NONE of the Books are live either.   This is convenient for sites where you might want to take several pages live all at once.

## "Standalone" items

(To be added from the PBSMM test case)

BUT sometimes you do NOT want the parent model to control its children.   Standalone models will NOT check their parents for permission.

For example you MIGHT want to limit the Books shown for a specific Author EXCEPT for this ONE Book.    So you can set `treat_as_standalone` for that one Book, and depending on the `live_as_of` and `publish_status` settings it will be "live" or not, WITHOUT checking to see what the same values are for that Book's Author.
